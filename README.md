## Description

## How to run
* **-- Option 1:** Run `main()` method from `Application.class`. This option is more suitable to failures, due to IDE dependency.
* **-- Option 2:** Requires Maven. Follow the steps [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). Once installed and added to the system path, run `mvn spring-boot:run`.

For both options, after running the app, browse to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to start using the application.
